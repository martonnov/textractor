Tool for caption extracting, generation and translation.

# Background
I couldn't find the caption download function on youtube, and the captions are often only available in only a single language. I wanted to have a tool that can be used for accessing the captions. If the captions are not existing, then it could generate them with a comprehension model. And the extracted texts could be converted between languages while they still make sense.
